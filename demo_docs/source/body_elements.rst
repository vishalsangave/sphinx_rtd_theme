Paragraphs
==========

A paragraph.

Inline Markup
-------------

Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*,
**strong emphasis**, ``inline literals``, standalone hyperlinks
(http://www.python.org), external hyperlinks (Python_), internal
cross-references (example_), external hyperlinks with embedded URIs
(`Python web site <http://www.python.org>`__), footnote references
(manually numbered [1]_, anonymous auto-numbered [#]_, labeled
auto-numbered [#label]_, or symbolic [*]_), citation references
([CIT2002]_), substitution references (|example|), and _`inline hyperlink targets`
(see Targets_ below for a reference back to here).
Character-level inline markup is also possible (although exceedingly ugly!)
in *re*\ ``Structured``\ *Text*.  Problems are indicated by |problematic| text
(generated by processing errors; this one is intentional).

The default role for interpreted text is `Title Reference`.  Here are
some explicit interpreted text roles: a PEP reference (:PEP:`287`); an
RFC reference (:RFC:`2822`); a :sub:`subscript`; a :sup:`superscript`;
and explicit roles for :emphasis:`standard` :strong:`inline` :literal:`markup`.

Paragraphs can be split like with the horizontal line below:

---------

GUI labels are a useful way to indicate that :guilabel:`Some action` is
to be taken by the user. The GUI label should not run over
``line-height`` so as not to :guilabel:`interfere` with text from adjacent lines.

Key-bindings indicate that the read is to press a button on the keyboard or mouse,
for example :kbd:`MMB` and :kbd:`Shift-MMB`. Another useful markup to indicate a user action
is to use ``menuselection`` this can be used to show short and long menus in software.
For example, and ``menuselection`` can be seen here that breaks is too long to fit on this line.
:menuselection:`My --> Software --> Some menu --> Some sub menu 1 --> sub menu 2`.

.. DO NOT RE-WRAP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!

Let's test wrapping and whitespace significance in inline literals:
``This is an example of --inline-literal --text, --including some--
strangely--hyphenated-words.  Adjust-the-width-of-your-browser-window
to see how the text is wrapped.  -- ---- --------  Now note    the
spacing    between the    words of    this sentence    (words
should    be grouped    in pairs).``

If the ``--pep-references`` option was supplied, there should be a live link to PEP 258 here.

Blocks
======

Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there ``-->``).  They can be indented::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Or they can be quoted without indentation::

>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?

Line Blocks
-----------

| This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.
|     Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
|     Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
| Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
  they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
|     The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
  the left edge of the text above it.

| This is a second line block.
|
| Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!

    | A one, two, a one two three four
    |
    | Half a bee, philosophically,
    |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
    | But half the bee has got to be,
    |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
    |
    | But can a bee be said to be
    |     or not to be an entire bee,
    |         when half the bee is not a bee,
    |             due to some ancient injury?
    |
    | Singing...

Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Doctest Blocks
--------------

>>> print 'Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"'
Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"
>>> print '(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)'
(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)

References
==========

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

.. [4] Here's an unreferenced footnote, with a reference to a
   nonexistent footnote: [5]_.

Citations
---------

.. [CIT2002] Citations are text-labeled footnotes. They may be
   rendered separately and differently from footnotes.

Here's a reference to the above, [CIT2002]_, and a [nonexistent]_ citation.

Glossary
--------

This is a glossary with definition terms for thing like :term:`Writing`:

.. glossary::
  
  Documentation
     Provides users with the knowledge they need to use something.

  Reading
     The process of taking information into ones mind through the use of eyes.

  Writing
     The process of putting thoughts into a medium for other people to :term:`read <Reading>`.

Targets
-------

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target. A
reference can be found under `Inline Markup`_, above. `Inline
hyperlink targets`_ are also possible.

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name. See
Targets_, which is a subsection of `Body Elements`_.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as "Python_".

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

Targets may be indirect and anonymous.  Thus `this phrase`__ may also
refer to the Targets_ section.

__ Targets_

Here's a `hyperlink reference without a target`_, which generates an error.

Duplicate Target Names
``````````````````````

Duplicate names in section headers or other implicit targets will
generate "info" (level-1) system messages.  Duplicate names in
explicit targets will generate "warning" (level-2) system messages.

Document Parts
``````````````

An example of the "contents" directive can be seen above this section
(a local, untitled table of contents_) and at the beginning of the
document (a document-wide `table of contents`_).

Centered text
`````````````

You can create a statement with centered text with ``.. centered::``

.. centered:: This is centered text!

Images
======

An image directive (also clickable -- a hyperlink reference):

.. image:: static/yi_jing_01_chien.jpg
   :target: directives_

A figure directive:

.. figure:: static/yi_jing_01_chien.jpg
   :alt: reStructuredText, the markup syntax

   A figure is an image with a caption and/or a legend:

   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | re         | Revised, revisited, based on 're' module.     |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Structured | Structure-enhanced text, structuredtext.      |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Text       | Well it is, isn't it?                         |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+

   This paragraph is also part of the legend.

A figure directive with center alignment

.. figure:: static/yi_jing_01_chien.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 300
   
   Captions on center figures should also be centered.

.. figure:: static/yi_jing_01_chien.jpg
   :align: right

   This is a caption for a figure. It can be very long and span several lines.

    Admonitions with math:

    :math:`G_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi G (T_{\mu\nu}  + \rho_\Lambda g_{\mu\nu})`.

.. Caution:: Don't take any wooden nickels.

    Every other line in this table will have white text on a white background. This is bad.

Topics, Sidebars, and Rubrics
`````````````````````````````

.. sidebar:: Sidebar Title
   :subtitle: Optional Subtitle

   This is a sidebar.  It is for text outside the flow of the main
   text.

   .. rubric:: This is a rubric inside a sidebar

   Sidebars often appears beside the main text with a border and
   background color.

.. topic:: Topic Title

   This is a topic.

.. rubric:: This is a rubric

Target Footnotes
````````````````

.. target-notes::

Replacement Text
````````````````

I recommend you try |Python|_.

.. |Python| replace:: Python, *the* best language around

Compound Paragraph
``````````````````

.. compound::

   This paragraph contains a literal block::

       Connecting... OK
       Transmitting data... OK
       Disconnecting... OK

   and thus consists of a simple paragraph, a literal block, and
   another simple paragraph.  Nonetheless it is semantically *one*
   paragraph.

This construct is called a *compound paragraph* and can be produced
with the "compound" directive.

Substitution Definitions
========================

An inline image (|example|) example:
